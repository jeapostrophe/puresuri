puresuri presentation system

Puresuri is a new way to make presentations in Racket using
picts. Unlike slideshow, it is based on a single logical canvas with
operations for adding and removing elements. Many ideas from
unstable/gui/ppict are used. Look at tests/example.rkt for an example. 

Run:

racket -t command.rkt -- tests/example.rkt

Try changing example.rkt while this is running.

Documentation to come.

TODO
- add as raco command
- add animation and juiciness
- separate location and composition in placers
- implement 'slide'
- replace PDF generation via latex with what slideshow does (plus fixes)
- make portals give you the pict of the slide so you can put it inside the current slide
