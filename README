puresuri presentation system

Puresuri is a new way to make presentations in Racket using
picts. Unlike slideshow, it is based on a single logical canvas with
operations for adding and removing elements. Many ideas from
unstable/gui/ppict are used. Look at tests/example.rkt for an example.

Documentation to come.
